## 🖼️ Image Assignments

### 1. **vision.jpg** (or vision.png)
**Your Image:** Image #1 - Four students with 3D-printed prosthetic hand  
**Location:** `public/images/vision.jpg`  
**Used in:** Vision section  
**Description:** Four young adults working collaboratively on a 3D-printed prosthetic hand with a 3D printer, circuit boards, and tools visible. Shows collaborative learning and innovation.

---

### 2. **problem.jpg** (or problem.png)
**Your Image:** Image #2 - Three students coding with robot  
**Location:** `public/images/problem.jpg`  
**Used in:** Problem section  
**Description:** Three students (2 males, 1 female) gathered around a laptop and small robot, working on robotics and coding. Perfect for showing hands-on robotics projects.

---

### 3. **who-we-are.jpg** (or who-we-are.png)
**Your Image:** Image #6 - Maker space with labeled zones (AI, Robotics, Drone)  
**Location:** `public/images/who-we-are.jpg`  
**Used in:** Who We Are section  
**Description:** Well-organized maker space with signs for "AI Learning Zone", "Robotics Bay", and "Drone Zone". Shows the actual facility layout with workstations, computers, drones, and 3D printer.

---

### 4. **facilities.jpg** (or facilities.png)
**Your Image:** Image #6 - Maker space with labeled zones (AI, Robotics, Drone)  
**Location:** `public/images/facilities.jpg`  
**Used in:** Facilities section  
**Description:** Same as above - the best image to showcase your state-of-the-art facilities with clearly labeled zones and equipment.

**Note:** You can use the same image for both `who-we-are.jpg` and `facilities.jpg`, or use Image #4 (Futuristic lab with 3D-printed robotic arm) for one of them if you prefer variety.

---

### 5. **what-students-learn.jpg** (or what-students-learn.png)
**Your Image:** Image #1 or Image #2  
**Location:** `public/images/what-students-learn.jpg`  
**Used in:** What Students Learn section  
**Description:** 
- **Option A:** Image #1 (Four students with prosthetic hand) - shows collaborative learning
- **Option B:** Image #2 (Three students coding with robot) - shows hands-on robotics learning

**Recommendation:** Use Image #1 if you used Image #2 for `problem.jpg`, or vice versa.

## 📁 File Structure

After saving all images, your folder structure should look like this:

```
public/
├── images/
│   ├── vision.jpg (or .png)
│   ├── problem.jpg (or .png)
│   ├── who-we-are.jpg (or .png)
│   ├── facilities.jpg (or .png)
│   └── what-students-learn.jpg (or .png)
└── favicon.svg
```

## ✅ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Save Image #1 as `vision.jpg` → `public/images/vision.jpg`
- [ ] Save Image #2 as `problem.jpg` → `public/images/problem.jpg`
- [ ] Save Image #6 as `who-we-are.jpg` → `public/images/who-we-are.jpg`
- [ ] Save Image #6 (or Image #4) as `facilities.jpg` → `public/images/facilities.jpg`
- [ ] Save Image #1 or Image #2 as `what-students-learn.jpg` → `public/images/what-students-learn.jpg`

## 🎨 Alternative Options

If you want more variety, here are alternative assignments:

- **who-we-are.jpg:** Image #4 (Futuristic lab with 3D-printed robotic arm) - more futuristic aesthetic
- **facilities.jpg:** Image #5 (Drone technology with AR glasses) - showcases drone facilities
- **facilities.jpg:** Image #7 (Humanoid robot with engineer) - shows advanced robotics facilities
- **what-students-learn.jpg:** Image #3 (Individual working on circuit board) - shows focused learning

## 📝 Notes

- All images support both `.jpg` and `.png` formats
- Images will automatically display once placed in the correct location
- The components are already configured to use these images
- If an image is missing, a placeholder will be shown instead
